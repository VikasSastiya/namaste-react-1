- To replace the syntex of code like to create "npx parcel index.html" to "npm start" just change from package.json ""scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html",
    "test": "jest"
  },"


  - to run the command to the server type npx parcel index.html

  - to start type npm run start same as parcel index.html

  -  Akshay Saini as in html replaced by Namaste React

  - JSX - jsx is a javascript syntax which is easier to create react element

  - if jsx syntex is in single line it is ok but if it is in multiple line it is merged in brackets

  - install some extensions like prittier,bracket pair coloriser which makes code easier
